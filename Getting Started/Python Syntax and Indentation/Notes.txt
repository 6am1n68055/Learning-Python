## Python Execution syntax

Python code can be either directly executed from command line or by creating a python file on the machine with extension ".py" and running the file on command line.
To execute a python file on command line, follow below format

    python /path_of_file/<filename.py>

##Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

For Example:

    if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")

Above code will run successfully, whereas below code will throw an error due to indentation

    if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error:
